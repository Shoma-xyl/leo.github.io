Hi, I'm an incoming PhD student from [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu), advised by [Corey E. Baker](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Baker/Corey). My research interests include machine learning methods and their applications in recommendation systems and autonomous systems.

I am passionate about exploring a wide range of applications in machine learning, particularly those that address real-world problems. I enjoy discussing ideas, asking questions, and thinking deeply about complex systems. Please contact me directly if interested!
